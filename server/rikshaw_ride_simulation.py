# To create a working simulation for the entire ride booking and management process, including user registration, booking a ride, confirming the ride, ride information, reaching the destination, payment, driver commission, and feedback from both the user and driver, we need to break down the process into several components and simulate them individually.
# Below is a basic Python code that demonstrates these functionalities:

# User registration: Creating a user instance.
# Driver registration: Creating a driver instance.
# User requests a ride.
# Driver accepts the ride.
# Ride confirmation.
# Start ride.
# Simulate ride progress.
# Complete ride.
# Simulate payment.
# Simulate feedback
